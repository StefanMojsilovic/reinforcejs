Reinforcement Learning Agents in Javascript (Dynamic Programming, Temporal Difference, Deep Q-Learning, Stochastic/Deterministic Policy Gradients)
## Credits
REINFORCEjs library is developed and maintained by Andrej Karpathy. Here, it is used under the MIT licence for studying and teaching purposes concerning RL and MDPs in the AI course at Aalto University
## Gridworld Dynamic programming Demo, Edit by Stefan Mojsilovic
[Gridworld Demo](gridworld_dp.html)
This edit includes:
- making the web interface more interactive: adding walls, changing start/goal state
- changing grid size (TODO) currently it can only be reduced by placing walls
- adding stochastic actions (TODO)
